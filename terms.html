    <li>Referral Program<br />
        <br />
        By participating in UPSTACK’s Referral Program (the “Program), you (“You” or “Referrer”) may fill out a survey online to submit the name of another person, not from the same organization or of relation to you, in order to get a Referral Reward. Subject to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”), when your Referred Customer submits a colocation project through the UPSTACK Marketplace and UPSTACK is able to verify this is a legitimate colocation opportunity, you will be eligible to choose one of several current rewards. An UPSTACK team member will contact you within one (1) business week from the time the Referred Customer’s project is submitted AND qualified. To receive multiple Rewards, you must introduce multiple Referred Customers who each submit a unique Qualified Colocation Project that can be traced back to your referral. You cannot refer yourself to earn a Referral Reward and projects submitted by Referred Customers who share your email address, company name and/or manage the same IT stack will not qualify for a Referral Reward. When sharing contact information, you agree that you will always tell your Referred Customers that you will receive a reward from UPSTACK if they submit a qualified colocation project through UPSTACK’s marketplace.<br />
        <br />
        LIMITS ON USE OF REFERRAL AND REWARD CODES<br />
        The Referrer has one (1) calendar year to redeem their reward. Use it or lose it.<br />
        <br />
        REWARD ELIGIBILITY<br />
        Eligibility to participate in the Program is limited to Corporations only; individuals with colocation needs are not applicable as Referred Customers. UPSTACK’s Program cannot be used by individuals or for affiliate lead generation or similar purposes, as determined in UPSTACK’s sole discretion. The use of multiple accounts, email addresses, online identities or aliases to circumvent the eligibility requirements and/or other limitations of these Terms is prohibited and may result in exclusion from the Program and the cancellation of all related rewards.<br />
        <br />
        NO SPAM OR POSTING OF REFERRAL<br />
        You should only share the contact information of your personal connections. You may not post or promote to your desire to earn a Reward on online forums, coupon sites or other websites with the intentions to collude against UPSTACK, by splitting the rewards with ill-gotten Referred Customers, as determined by UPSTACK’s in its sole discretion. You must also comply with all laws governing the transmission of email or other electronic communications. UPSTACK reserves the right to deactivate any referral accounts and to revoke all related Referral Rewards.<br />
        <br />
        RIGHT TO REVOKE REWARDS<br />
        UPSTACK’s reserves the right to revoke rewards or ban future participation in the Program if UPSTACK suspects that you (or any Referred Customer you refer to UPSTACK) has used or attempted to use the Program in a fraudulent or abusive manner or in violation of these Terms or applicable law.<br />
        <br />
        RIGHT TO CANCEL REWARD PROGRAM AND CHANGE TERMS<br />
        This Referral Program and these Terms are subject to modification or termination at any time without notice in our sole discretion. If we terminate the Program, all unused Referral Rewards will be revoked and forfeited at that time.</li>
