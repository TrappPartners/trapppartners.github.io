The safety and security of your information also depends on you.

We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Accordingly, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our Services.  You transmit all such information at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.<br /> &nbsp;</li>

The third parties who operate such websites may use tracking technologies. Please read the privacy policies of these third party websites and Third Party Organizations (as defined in the Terms of Use) carefully before browsing or providing any information on such websites.  We are not responsible for your activities or any collection or tracking of your information on such sites.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
